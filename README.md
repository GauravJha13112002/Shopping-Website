Project Output : https://gauravjha13112002.github.io/NextCart-Online-Shopping-Platform/

Description

This is a frontend-only Angular-based E-Commerce web application developed to simulate a real-world online shopping experience.
The application includes user authentication (login/signup), category-wise product listing (Electronics, Bags, etc.), and cart management.
It focuses on clean UI, modular Angular architecture, and practical implementation of core Angular concepts.

Features

1) User Authentication with Login & Signup
2) Category-wise Product Listing Electronics, Bags, etc.
3) Add to Cart & Remove from Cart functionality
4) Global Cart Service for managing cart state across components

Technologies Used

Angular,TypeScript,HTML,CSS

How It Works 
1) Users can register or log in using the authentication module.
2) After login, users can browse products categorized into sections like Electronics and Bags.
3) Each product can be added to the cart using a shared Cart Service.
4) The cart dynamically updates items and reflects changes across the application.
5) Angular Routing is used for smooth navigation between pages.
6) Reusable components and services ensure clean and maintainable code structure.



# Shopping Website

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.0.4.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
